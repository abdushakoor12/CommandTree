# Code Dedup

Carefully search for duplicate code, duplicate tests, and dead code across the repo. Merge duplicates and delete dead code — but only when test coverage proves the change is safe.

## Prerequisites — hard gate

Before touching ANY code, verify these conditions. If any fail, stop and report why.

1. Run `make test` — all tests must pass. If tests fail, stop. Do not dedup a broken codebase.
2. `make test` is fail-fast AND enforces the coverage threshold from `coverage-thresholds.json`. If anything fails, stop and fix it before deduping.
3. This is a TypeScript repo. Confirm `tsconfig.json` has `"strict": true` (it does). Proceed.

## Steps

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Dedup Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Prerequisites passed (tests green, coverage met, typed)
- [ ] Step 2: Dead code scan complete
- [ ] Step 3: Duplicate code scan complete
- [ ] Step 4: Duplicate test scan complete
- [ ] Step 5: Changes applied
- [ ] Step 6: Verification passed (tests green, coverage stable)
```

### Step 1 — Inventory test coverage

Before deciding what to touch, understand what is tested.

1. Run `make test` to confirm green baseline. `make test` is fail-fast AND enforces the coverage thresholds from `coverage-thresholds.json` (REPO-STANDARDS-SPEC [TEST-RULES], [COVERAGE-THRESHOLDS-JSON]). It exits non-zero on any test failure OR coverage shortfall.
2. Note the current coverage percentages — these are the floor. They must not drop.
3. Identify which files/modules have coverage and which do not. Only files WITH coverage are candidates for dedup.

### Step 2 — Scan for dead code

Search for code that is never called, never imported, never referenced.

1. Look for unused exports, unused functions, unused classes, unused variables
2. TypeScript-specific tooling:
   - `tsconfig.json` has `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters` — the compiler already warns on unused locals/params
   - ESLint flags unused exports via `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`
   - Look for unexported functions with zero references within the module
3. For each candidate: **grep the entire codebase** for references (including tests, scripts, configs). Only mark as dead if truly zero references.
4. List all dead code found with file paths and line numbers. Do NOT delete yet.

### Step 3 — Scan for duplicate code

Search for code blocks that do the same thing in multiple places.

1. Look for functions/methods with identical or near-identical logic
2. Look for copy-pasted blocks (same structure, maybe different variable names)
3. Look for multiple implementations of the same algorithm or pattern
4. Check across discovery providers in `src/discovery/` — duplicates often hide in similar providers
5. For each duplicate pair: note both locations, what they do, and how they differ (if at all)
6. List all duplicates found. Do NOT merge yet.

### Step 4 — Scan for duplicate tests

Search for tests that verify the same behavior.

1. Look for test functions with identical assertions against the same code paths
2. Look for test fixtures/helpers duplicated across test files
3. Look for integration tests that fully cover what a unit test also covers (keep the integration/E2E test, mark the unit test as redundant per CLAUDE.md rules)
4. List all duplicate tests found. Do NOT delete yet.

### Step 5 — Apply changes (one at a time)

For each change, follow this cycle: **change → test → verify coverage → continue or revert**.

#### 5a. Remove dead code
- Delete dead code identified in Step 2
- After each deletion: run `make test` (fail-fast + coverage + threshold all in one)
- If `make test` exits non-zero: **revert immediately** and investigate
- Dead code removal should never break tests or drop coverage

#### 5b. Merge duplicate code
- For each duplicate pair: extract the shared logic into a single function/module
- Update all call sites to use the shared version
- After each merge: run `make test`
- If tests fail: **revert immediately**. The duplicates may have subtle differences you missed.
- If coverage drops: the shared code must have equivalent test coverage. Add tests if needed before proceeding.

#### 5c. Remove duplicate tests
- Delete the redundant test (keep the more thorough one)
- After each deletion: run `make test`
- If coverage drops below threshold, `make test` exits non-zero — **revert immediately**. The "duplicate" test was covering something the other wasn't.

### Step 6 — Final verification

1. Run `make lint` — ESLint + cspell must pass
2. Run `make test` — tests must pass AND coverage must remain ≥ the baseline from Step 1
3. Report: what was removed, what was merged, final coverage vs baseline

## Rules

- **No test coverage = do not touch.** If a file has no tests covering it, leave it alone entirely. You cannot safely dedup what you cannot verify.
- **Coverage must not drop.** If removing or merging code causes coverage to decrease, revert and investigate. The coverage floor from Step 1 is sacred.
- **One change at a time.** Make one dedup change, run tests, verify coverage. Never batch multiple dedup changes before testing.
- **When in doubt, leave it.** If two code blocks look similar but you're not 100% sure they're functionally identical, leave both. False dedup is worse than duplication.
- **Preserve public API surface.** Do not change exported function signatures, class names, or module exports. Internal refactoring only.
- **Three similar lines is fine.** Do not create abstractions for trivial duplication. Only dedup when the shared logic is substantial (>10 lines) or when there are 3+ copies.
